## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Diego Vigneron, and I am a Computer Science student at the Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM). I am currently pursuing a Master's in Artificial Intelligence, where I am developing my expertise in machine learning, data science, and AI algorithms.

I am passionate about building intelligent systems and solving complex problems with code. My academic journey has given me a strong foundation in a variety of technologies and programming languages. I am actively looking for opportunities to apply my skills in real-world projects.
